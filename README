********************
The YouGitIt Project
********************

This project makes managing Unity3D packages and their dependencies easier.  This is pre-alpha software, so feel free to help improve it.

To get started, import YouGitIt.unitypackage into your project.  Then, set your dependencies in a .txt file under the "Dependencies" directory.  For example, if your project depends on the June and Euclid projects, your dependency text file would contain:

https://github.com/srfoster/June
https://github.com/srfoster/Euclid

Your project's developers can obtain the latest versions of the June and Euclid projects by opening Window > YouGitIt and pressing the "Git It!" button.  This will download the latest Unity3D package files from these git projects, placing them in the "YouGotIt" folder.  They can then be imported by double-clicking them.

If the newly imported projects support YouGitIt (and if they have dependencies) their dependency files will appear in your "Dependency" directory.  You can use the "YouGitIt" window again to obtain these second-level dependencies.  And so on.
